LendingClub data analysis repo

This repository has following contents:
 - **ML_recruitment_task.pdf**: The ML case description for a Data Scientist position. They usually give you 5 days to delivery the work.
 - **ML_Task_presentation.pdf**: Final presentation summarizing all the work done in notebooks.
 - Folders:
  - **notebooks**: All three notebooks where I talk about Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and Model Definition and Analysis.
  - **src**: Python files used to modularize code and help producing reliable pipelines.
  - **reports**: html report done using pandas profiling.
  
  
  **Important:** I really put a significant amount of effort in doing the best analysis with *quality* as possible in time given for the task. So, I kindly ask
  to anywho that is evaluating my skills, to see code inside notebook and src.
